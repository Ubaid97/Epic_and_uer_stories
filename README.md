# Epic and User stories

## Epic stories
-  An epic story is usually one big piece of product functionality which 
can be broken down into smaller stories
- A use case is a description of a particular functionality will be 
implemented. It will include the agents performing actions (eg users) 
and the system's behaviour, detailing the sequence of steps the agents 
will need to take in order to fulfill the goal of the functionality

## User stories
- User stories express needs that users have. they will typically 
consist of a certain functioniality users will want to perform (eg send 
email). 
- Use cases will describe the sequence of steps the agents will need to 
take, and how the system will need behave in response, in order to meet 
the need in the user story  

## How these relate to Agile and Scrum
- In an Agile environment, scrum is a very useful framework to adopt, 
and scrum will split the workload into sprints. each sprint will have 
certain functionalities to be implemented as their goal.
- Epic stories consist of quite large and complex functionalities which 
usually cannot be completed in a single sprint
- Instead, epic stories are broken down into smaller user stories, which 
can be completed in a single sprint.
- Use cases will then outline what these functionalities consist of
