## Epic stories
-  An epic story is usually one big piece of product functionality which 
can be broken down into smaller stories
- A use case is a description of a particular functionality will be 
implemented. It will include the agents performing actions (eg users) 
and the system's behaviour, detailing the sequence of steps the agents 
will need to take in order to fulfill the goal of the functionality
